#### **Step 4: Add All Your Files to Git**

This command "stages" all the files in your project (except for those listed in `.gitignore`) to be saved.

```bash
git add .
```
(The `.` means "everything in this folder and subfolders").

#### **Step 5: Save Your Files (Commit)**

This command saves a snapshot of your project with a descriptive message.

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit of Timeless Tribe full-stack project"
```

#### **Step 6: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub**

Go to your empty repository page on GitHub and copy the URL. Now, run this command in your terminal, replacing the placeholder with your actual URL.

```bash
# Replace the URL with your own repository's URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

To verify it worked, you can type `git remote -v` and you should see your repository URL listed.

#### **Step 7: Push Your Code to GitHub**

This is the final step that uploads your committed files to the GitHub server.

```bash
git push -u origin main
