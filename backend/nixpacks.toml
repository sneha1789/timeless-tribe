    # Tell Railway to use the Node.js environment, version 18.
    providers = ["node@18"]

    # Tell Railway what command to run after installing dependencies.
    [start]
    cmd = "npm start"
    ```

#### **Step 2: Remove Old Settings from Railway**

The `nixpacks.toml` file now controls the build process, so we must remove the manual commands from the Railway dashboard to avoid conflicts.

1.  Go to your project on Railway.
2.  Click on your backend service, then go to the **"Settings"** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **"Build"** section.
4.  **Delete** the "**Custom Build Command**" (`npm install`) that we added previously.
5.  Scroll down to the **"Deploy"** section.
6.  **Delete** the "**Start Command**" (`npm start`) that we added previously.
7.  **Verify** that the **"Root Directory"** (under the "Service" section) is still set to `/backend`.

#### **Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub**

Now, commit the new `nixpacks.toml` file and push it to your GitHub repository.

1.  In your terminal (inside the `timeless-tribe-fullstack` root folder), run these commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "FIX: Add nixpacks.toml for Railway deployment"
    git push origin main
